As a PhD student in earth sciences, I focus on modelling past cliamte using the [cGENIE](https://www.seao2.info/mymuffin.html) framework (the best model in the world). I try to evaluate existing hypotheses and understand the mechanisms that can trigger and maintain anoxia as part of the WarmAnoxia project. The incorporation of geological, chemical, and biological data into the model, will help us to investigate the possible links between astronomical forcing and anoxic events throughout the Devonian period.
